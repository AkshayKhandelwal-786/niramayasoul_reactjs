                      Like most website operators, NiramayaSoul collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. NiramayaSoul’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how NiramayaSoul’s visitors use its website. From time to time, NiramayaSoul may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

                    <p>
                      NiramayaSoul also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on NiramayaSoul blog posts. NiramayaSoul only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

The amount and type of information that NiramayaSoul gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at NiramayaSoul to provide a username and email address.
