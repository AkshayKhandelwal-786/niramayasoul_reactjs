                    <h3>What is PrEP?</h3>
                    <p>
                      PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is medicine people at risk for HIV take to prevent getting HIV from sex or injection drug use. PrEP can stop HIV from taking hold and spreading throughout your body.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Currently, there are two FDA-approved daily oral medications for PrEP. A long-acting injectable form of PrEP has also been approved by the FDA.

                    <h3>Why Take PrEP?</h3>
                    <p>
                      PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV when taken as indicated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      PrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% when taken as prescribed. Among people who inject drugs, it reduces the risk by at least 74% when taken as prescribed. PrEP is much less effective when it isn't taken consistently.

                          <li>have a sexual partner with HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load),</li>
                          <li>have not consistently used a condom, or</li>
                          <li>have been diagnosed with an STD in the past 6 months.</li>

                      <li>
                        you’ve been prescribed PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) and you

                          <li>report continued risk behavior or</li>
                          <li>have used multiple courses of PEP.</li>

                      If you are a woman and have a partner with HIV and are considering getting pregnant, talk to your doctor about PrEP. PrEP may be an option to help protect you and your baby from getting HIV while you try to get pregnant, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding.

                    <h3>What Drugs Are Approved for PrEP?</h3>
                    <p>
                      There are two oral medications approved for daily use as PrEP. They are combinations of two anti-HIV drugs in a single pill:

                    <h3>Is PrEP Safe?</h3>
                    <p>
                      PrEP is safe. No significant health effects have been seen in people who are HIV-negative and have taken PrEP for up to 5 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Some people taking PrEP may have side effects, like nausea, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, and stomach pain. These side effects are usually not serious and go away over time. If you are taking PrEP, tell your health care provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      And be aware: PrEP protects you against HIV but not against other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or other types of infections. Combining PrEP with condoms will reduce your risk of getting other STIs.

                    <h3>How Do You Get PrEP?</h3>
                    <p>
                      If you think PrEP may be right for you, visit your doctor or health care provider. PrEP is only available by prescription. Any health care provider licensed to write prescriptions can prescribe PrEP; specialization in infectious diseases or HIV medicine is not required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you don’t have a doctor, you can use the HIV Services Locator to find a PrEP provider and other HIV services near you. You can visit many community health centers for a PrEP consultation. More than 190 health centers in the 57 jurisdictions prioritized in the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative are providing PrEP services. Many health centers in other jurisdictions also provide PrEP services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Because PrEP is for people who are HIV-negative, you’ll have to get an HIV test before starting PrEP and you may need to get other tests to make sure it’s safe for you to use PrEP.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you take PrEP, you’ll need to see your health care provider every 3 months for repeat HIV tests, prescription refills, and follow-up.
